Tailscale VPN Deployment & Zero-Trust Network Setup

Author: Ty Iorfino
Date: September - November 2025
Tools Used: Tailscale, Proxmox VE, Pi-hole, Docker, Ubuntu Server, Windows 10/11, MagicDNS, WireGuard, ACL Policies

Project Overview
- This project documents how I installed, configured, and deployed Tailscale VPN across a hybrid environment consisting of Proxmox nodes, Linux containers (LXC), Windows hosts, and an IOS system.
- The goal was to create a secure, encrypted, zero-trust mesh network allowing me to connect remotely to my home lab and manage local services safely from anywhere.
- All communication between devices occurs over WireGuard-based encrypted tunnels, ensuring privacy and integrity while allowing remote access.

System Architecture
- Environment: 
  - Proxmox VE hosting multiple Linux Containers (LXC) and Dockerized services
  - Windows 11 workstation for client connectivity and administrative access
  - Pi-hole container acting as a DNS sinkhole and network exit node for ad blocking and traffic routing
  - Tailscale used to interconnect all nodes under a single identity and enforce zero-trust policies
- Core Concepts Used:
  - MagicDNS for hostname-based communication between nodes
  - Access Control Lists to manage least-privilege access
  - Exit Nodes for encrypted remote browsing through my home network
  - Subnet Routing for LXC and Docker access within Proxmox

Deployment steps
1. Installing Tailscale
- I made an account on tailscales offical website and then had them generate me download code based on my system
- I began by installing Tailscale on each system in my network:
- On Ubuntu / LXC containers:
      curl -fsSL https://tailscale.com/install.sh | sh
      tailscale up --authkey <your-auth-key> --hostname <device-name>
- On Windows:
      - Downloaded the Tailscale client from tailscale.com/download
      - Signed in using my Tailscale account using gmail
      - Connected the device to my personal tailnet.

---

2. Establishing a Secure Mesh Network
- Once all systems were connected, Tailscale automatically formed a peer-to-peer mesh network using the WireGuard protocol.
- This allowed every device to communicate directly and securely, even across NAT or different subnets, without manual port forwarding.

--- 

3. Enabling MagicDNS
- I enabled MagicDNS through the Tailscale Admin Console for automatic hostname resolution:
    - Eliminated the need to remember IPs
    - Allowed access using simple hostnames like proxmox.local or pihole.local
    - Ensured cross-device consistency for DNS queries

---

4. Configuring Pi-hole as Exit Node
- My Pi-hole container was configured to act as an exit node, routing all outbound internet traffic through my home network:
    sudo tailscale up --exit-node=true --exit-node-allow-lan-access
- This setup ensured:
    - Encrypted browsing from remote locations
    - DNS-level ad and tracker blocking via Pi-hole
    - Consistent network policies across devices

---

5. Implementing Zero-Trust with ACLs
- Using the Tailscale Admin Console, I defined ACL rules in JSON to control access between users and devices.
For example, administrative nodes were restricted to specific authenticated users only:

{
  "ACLs": [
    {
      "Action": "accept",
      "Users": ["ty@domain.com"],
      "Ports": ["proxmox:22", "pihole:80"]
    }
  ]
}

This ensured all users operated under least privilege and only had access to necessary resources.

---

6. Integrating with Proxmox Networking
- I configured Proxmox virtual networks so that containerized services (LXCs and Docker containers) were reachable through the Tailscale interface.
- This allowed remote SSH, web UI, and API access through secure tunnels without public IP exposure.

---

7. Admin Console & Key Management
- I managed all devices and users through the Tailscale Admin Console:
- Reviewed connected devices and activity
- Rotated authentication keys for security hygiene
- Verified key expiration and session validity
- Monitored traffic routes and ACL policy application

---

8. End-to-End Testing
- To validate network integrity, I conducted connectivity and DNS propagation tests across:
  - Ubuntu LXCs
  - Docker containers
  - Windows hosts
- Commands like ping, dig, and curl were used to verify encrypted tunnels and hostname resolution via MagicDNS.

---

Security Outcomes
- All VPN connections are encrypted end-to-end using WireGuard.
- DNS-level ad-blocking through Pi-hole enhances privacy and reduces bandwidth waste.
- Zero-Trust ACL framework enforces least privilege and limits lateral movement.
- MagicDNS ensures reliable hostname resolution across all devices.
- Remote management of Proxmox and local services without exposing public ports.

Technology Used
- Tailscale:	VPN and Zero-Trust network orchestration
- WireGuard:	Encryption backbone for mesh connectivity
- Proxmox VE:	Virtualization platform for hosting containers and VMs
- Pi-hole:	DNS sinkhole and network-level ad-blocker
- MagicDNS:	Hostname resolution and internal name mapping
- ACL Policies:	Access control and least-privilege enforcement
- Docker:	Service containerization
- Ubuntu Server / Windows 11	Operating systems for deployment

Conclusion
- Through this project, I built a fully encrypted, zero-trust VPN infrastructure that connects multiple environments under one secure network.
- This setup demonstrates my ability to design, deploy, and manage modern VPN solutions using Tailscale and WireGuard, while integrating with virtualization platforms like Proxmox and enhancing privacy with Pi-hole.
